All assignments for python section will be added here.

### 1. Hello World Script
This is the first program for any language. Create a python script that prints "Hello World" to the command-line.

### 2. Odd or Even Script 
Take the following code and make sure
```python
# copy this code into your file and use it for this assignment.

# this is an example function
def add_ten(x):
     print x + 10  # notice this is indented

# YOUR CODE WILL GO INTO THIS FUNCTION
def print_even_or_odd(x):
   # 1. remember the logic in this function must be indented
   # 2. to determine whether a number is even: x % 2 is EQUAL to 0
   # 3. to determine whether a number is odd: x % 2 is NOT EQUAL to 0
   # basic logic:
   #
   # if x % 2 is equal to 0, then print "even"
   # else then print "odd"
   #
   # code the above logic in this function
   


a = 894754
b = 1
c = 0
d = -1
e = 2
f = 99999999993449

# call the example function, example output should be:
#
# 894764
# 
add_ten(a) # this will send the variable "a" to add_ten() and store contents of "a" into "x" and then do the operation

# now you must call print_even_or_odd() and the output should be what you expect
print_even_or_odd(a)
print_even_or_odd(b)
print_even_or_odd(c)
print_even_or_odd(d)
print_even_or_odd(e)
print_even_or_odd(f)

# this should print "even"!!!!!
```
