### 1. Hello World script
This is the first program for any language. Create a python script that prints "Hello World" to the command-line.

### 2. Variables and Data Types: Strings and Integers 
Take the following code and make sure
```python
# copy this code into your file and use it for this assignment.

# this is an example function
def add_ten(x):
     print x + 10  # notice this is indented

# YOUR CODE WILL GO INTO THIS FUNCTION
def print_even_or_odd(x):
   # remember the logic in this function must be indented


a = 894754
b = 1
c = 0
d = -1
e = 2
f = 99999999993449

# call the example function, example output should be:
#
# 894764
# 
add_ten(a) # this will send the variable "a" to add_ten() and store contents of "a" into "x" and then do the operation

# now you must call print_even_or_odd() and the output should be what you expect
print_even_or_odd(a)

# this should print "even"!!!!!
```
